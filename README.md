👋 Hi, I'm Nico!
I'm a Systems Engineering student passionate about building software that supports real-world businesses and meaningful progress. I'm especially interested in tools that help organizations grow, improve workflows, and contribute to honest and efficient systems.

🎓 I'm currently completing my degree in Systems Engineering at UTN, and about to earn my Systems Analyst degree.

🧠 I enjoy applying technical skills to real problems, especially where tech meets agriculture, health, logistics, or public services.

💼 My projects aim to blend good design, robust architecture, and real utility — whether it's for startups, institutions, or independent professionals.

🚀 I'm looking to collaborate on purpose-driven software, especially projects that challenge me to grow and deepen my understanding.

🛠️ Interested in system design, backend development, and human-centered software.

📫 Feel free to reach out via DM or open an issue on one of my repos — I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.
